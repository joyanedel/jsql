# Introduction

JSQL is a file based relational database management system (RDBMS) which only purpose is to serve as an introduction to database programming to me. There is no intention on turning this project in a production ready system.

The project is coded in Rust due to its versatility with enumerations and safety. Nothing about `blazingly fast` will be mentioned here, and, as a matter of fact, you will raise your hands over your head wishing the answer about some decisions I will make along the project.
